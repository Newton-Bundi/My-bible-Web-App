**Description**
This web application allows you to read verses from different bible versions and add comments and similar bible passages.
The web page displays the most well-known verse: John 3:16, once it's loaded or refreshed. 
The user can then choose a new verse and add comments on it and link it to a similar passage.
The end goal of this web page is to have a repository of different interpretations of verses based on the users.

**Project setup instructions**
The project has the following contents:
- A folder named assets containing all the images used in the web page
- A folder named src containing the javascript file
- A folder named styles containing the CSS file used to style the web page
- 4 files including:
    - a html file containing the contents of the webpage
    - a JSON file that can be used to store the submitted comments and passages from users
    - a license file containing detailed information on copyright and licensing for this project
    - this READme file
 
With these folders and files intact, the successful launch of the web application only involves opening the link provided in the next section (Link to live site).
Additionally, you can fork the project to your own GitHub account, clone it to your local repository and open the HTML file through the bash command 'open index.html'

**Link to live site on GitHub Pages**
Apologies, currently, a link can not be provided but upon successful review of the project by my instructors I shall make it a public repository and hence will be able to include it in GitHub Pages.
